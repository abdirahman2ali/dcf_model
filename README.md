### Discount Cash Flow Model

A basic DCF model involves projecting future cash flows and discounting them back to the present using a discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) that reflects the riskiness of the capital. You then add up all those discounted cash flows. The sum is really the intrinsic value of the company (equity value). The DCF model is based on the Google stocked forecasted in the next 5 years. We have a few assumptions, which are revenue growth, cost of capital, and perpertuity growth.
